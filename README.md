# Traffic Data Generation for Falcon NGSIEM
Welcome to the Traffic Data Generation project! This repository is designed to help security professionals and researchers generate realistic traffic data logs for testing and validating their NGSIEM (Next-Generation Security Information and Event Management) setup. The data includes simulated web server logs, Zscaler logs, network appliance logs, and Windows server logs, complete with malicious beacons and realistic scenarios.

## Overview
This project uses Python and the Faker library to generate realistic data logs. It includes a menu-driven system for ease of use, allowing you to configure and generate logs dynamically.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- The following Python libraries:
  - requests
  - pyyaml
  - faker
